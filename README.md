Developed a tool for keyword-based search and retrieval of Open Government Data.

The Objective of Open Government Data Platform India is to facilitate the access to Government owned shareable data and information in both human readable and machine readable forms in a proactive and periodically updatable manner, within the framework of various related policies, Acts and Rules of Government of India, thereby promoting wider accessibility and application of government owned data and unlocking the potential of data for national development.

Data.gov.in hosts an array of government data spanning diverse sectors like census, agriculture, finance, defense, education, pollution and more.

The datagov_key.py uses a sample API token which will return a maximum of 10 records at a time. The API Key can be availed from data.gov.in. After Registration, the API Key can be generated from the Dashboard-> My Account menu.
